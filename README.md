# TextAdventureTemplate-Unity

A text adventure template with a time travel mechanic. I created this in August of 2018 in Unity, including a short demo that can be modified and expanded on, with menus, settings, and audio. The template supports simple item puzzles with containers and an inventory system. Additionally, the game supports a time-travel mechanic where each location has two representations in two different time periods.
